\section{Outcomes}
The proposed system is to access the performance of stochastic optimization
methods in structural modelling since the architecture is intended to ease the
accessing process Furthermore, the proposed system whose research is being
2
carried out will be very useful to any other researchers who may wish to
venture into still the same or nearly the same developments in the technology
world.

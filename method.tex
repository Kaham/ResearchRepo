\section{Methodology}
	
	We intend to use observation, interviews, and review literation of the collected
data from the various sources about stochastic optimization methods in struc-
tural modelling. The data collected will be subjected to analysis in order to
ensure consistency in modelling the system. The data collected will be grouped
into functional and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements will
specify what the system will do while the non-functional requirements will be
the overall constraints. Tools such as SPSS are to be used as they are auto-
mated and give quick results. The system will be designed by the use of use
case diagrams and data ow diagrams that will help to explain how the ac-
tors will interact with the system. We intend to use visual studio and C++
to implement and access the performance of stochastic optimization methods
in structural modeling in order to produce a prototype basing on the user re-
quirements. The system will be tested to achieve the forth objective using unit
testing and system testing. Thereafter the system will be taken to the users for
validation to ensure that it operates to their satisfaction.
